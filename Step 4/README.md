"""
The () notebook analyzes Formula 1 race strategies using Monte Carlo simulations.
It starts by preparing lap time data and tire degradation models, then simulates different 1-stop strategies (Soft→Medium, Soft→Hard, Medium→Hard).
Safety Car dynamics are incorporated with probabilistic deployment to assess their effect on race times.
Finally, the notebook visualizes results with histograms to compare strategy efficiency and variability, helping identify the most robust race strategy under uncertainty.
